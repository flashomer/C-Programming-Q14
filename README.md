# C-Programming

- Define a student structure consisting of id, name, surname, and cgpa. Write a program that reads the 
information about some students from a text file whose name is given as input, validates the file name, and 
copies them into a binary file, with the same name but with the extension .bin. The program then displays a 
menu with the options:
1) Go to student X from top
2) Move X students ahead
3) Go X students back from bottom
4) Exit
and performs the chosen operation, by taking the value of X as a positive integer, and displaying the 
information of the student reached after the operation.
